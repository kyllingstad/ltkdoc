LTKdoc
======

LTKdoc is a very simple DDOC theme.  Currently, it may be used to format the
documentation of individual modules as pure HTML5 (with embedded CSS).  It
does not provide a way to browse and move between different modules.

To use it, simply provide the compiler with the path to the `ltk.ddoc` file,
like this:

    dmd -D my_module.ddoc /path/to/ltk.ddoc
